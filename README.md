In our project we attempted to tackle a problem that exists with most students today. Students are becoming more and more overwhelmed with the amount of schoolwork given to them. They struggle to maintain a clear and concise way to organize their work. In turn students become stressed and need for organization tools to accommodate their busy schedules
With a TODO app students will be able to have all of their work and tasks in one place which make for easy organization. Students add tasks and check them off as they are completed. Students can set the priority and status of specific tasks. Tasks can then be sorted either by due date, or difficulty of the task. Some additional features that we added was the ability to share tasks with other users of the app. After creating a task a user can add another user to the task so it will show up in both of their apps. This can be very useful for group projects or coordinating on an assignment. Another feature was the security of our app. We have multi-factor authentication for logging in and password encrypted files. 
Overall we wanted to provide a solution to a problem that we see so many students struggling with throughout college. We believe that with our TODO app students will be able to be more organized and stay on top of their work.
